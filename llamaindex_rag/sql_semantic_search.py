"""
LlamaIndex Semantic SQL (NetworkAnalytics worker).

Connects to data/telecom_ops.db, builds an ObjectIndex over human-readable
descriptions of the analytics tables so a question can be semantically
matched to the right table(s), and exposes a SQLTableRetrieverQueryEngine
via a single `answer_network_analytics_question` function.

Per the project spec: LlamaIndex is used ONLY for retrieval/query
synthesis here - the query engine generates and runs the SQL itself, this
module never hand-writes business-data queries or caches rows in Python.
