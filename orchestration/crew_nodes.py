"""
CrewAI Customer Communications crew (CustomerCommsCrew worker).

A two-agent sequential crew: a Communications Specialist drafts a
customer-facing response from the original query plus every upstream
worker's accumulated findings (agent_context), and a Quality Reviewer
checks tone/accuracy/policy compliance and outputs only the final text.

Exposes one function - generate_customer_response - for the LangGraph node
to call.
