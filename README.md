# Prodapt AI Operations Center — Capstone Implementation

Multi-framework agentic AI system for a fictional telecom provider, built per
`capstone-project-specification.html` (also kept under its original given
filename, `Agentic AI Project .html`): a **LangGraph** supervisor routes customer/staff
inquiries to specialist workers powered by **LlamaIndex** (document RAG +
semantic SQL), **Google ADK** (A2A microservices with SQL-backed tools), and
**CrewAI** (final customer-facing communications), surfaced through a
**Streamlit** UI with a full agent execution trace.

> Runs on **Anthropic Claude** by default (one `LLM_PROVIDER` switch in
> `.env` can point the whole stack at OpenAI instead) — see `HOW_TO_RUN.md`
> for the exact setup.

## Setup

**Requires Python 3.10+.** A `.venv/` with every dependency already installed and
verified (see Verification below) is included in this folder — just activate it:

```bash
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Setting up from scratch elsewhere:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate      macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, either way:

```bash
copy .env.example .env      # Windows (or: cp .env.example .env)
# edit .env and set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

`LLM_PROVIDER` in `.env` is the one switch that drives every LLM call in the
project — the LangGraph supervisor, LlamaIndex's answer synthesis, CrewAI,
and (by default) the ADK agents too. It defaults to `anthropic`, so **only
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is required** out of the box. Set `LLM_PROVIDER=openai`
and `OPENAI_API_KEY` to run the whole stack on OpenAI instead, or leave
`LLM_PROVIDER` as-is and set `ADK_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash` + `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
to run just the ADK agents on Gemini.

## Run order

All commands are from the `capstone-project/` project root.

1. **Build the database** (creates `data/telecom_ops.db` from the provided SQL scripts):
   ```bash
   python init_db.py
   ```
   Expect `network_towers: 10 rows` and one flagged duplicate charge for `CUST-10002`.

2. **Start both ADK A2A services**, each in its own terminal:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   python adk-services/network_diagnostics/agent.py
   # Terminal 2
   python adk-services/billing_resolution/agent.py
   ```
   Verify the agent cards are up:
   `http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent-card.json`
   `http://localhost:8002/.well-known/agent-card.json`

3. **Start the Streamlit UI** in a third terminal:
   ```bash
   streamlit run ui/app.py
   ```
   The first PolicyRAG query will build and persist the vector index to
   `data/vector_index/` (subsequent runs load it instantly). The sidebar
   shows live status for the database, vector index, and both ADK services.

## Demo scenarios (from the spec, section 9)

| # | Try this query | Expected routing |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "What is Prodapt's roaming policy for Western Europe?" | PolicyRAG → CustomerCommsCrew |
| 2 | "Which region had the most CRITICAL network outages?" | NetworkAnalytics → CustomerCommsCrew (answer: Midwest) |
| 3 | "My 5G keeps dropping in Austin near tower TX-512. Please diagnose." | NetworkDiagnosticsADK → CustomerCommsCrew |
| 4 | "Customer CUST-10002 was charged twice for Unlimited Plus. Investigate and apply credit." | BillingResolutionADK → CustomerCommsCrew (credit is PENDING_APPROVAL, $65.99 > $50 limit, balance stays $131.98) |
| 5 | "We had a 6-hour outage in the Midwest. Am I eligible for an SLA credit and what does policy say?" | NetworkAnalytics → PolicyRAG → CustomerCommsCrew |

More practice queries (with expected answers, useful while developing/demoing)
are in section 9.7 of `capstone-project-specification.html`.

## Verification

Everything below was actually run (not just written) against the real
libraries in `.venv`, without spending any LLM API calls:

- `init_db.py` builds the database; every scenario anchor from the spec
  (CUST-10002 balance/duplicate, TX-512/FL-090 latest-sample metrics, Midwest
  CRITICAL outage counts, packet-loss ranking) matches exactly.
- All three Billing Resolution tools (`lookup_billing_account`,
  `check_duplicate_charges`, `apply_billing_credit`) were called directly
  against the live database: the $50 auto-approval boundary (12.00 → APPLIED,
  50.00 → APPLIED, 65.99 → PENDING_APPROVAL) and the duplicate-detection query
  both match the spec's worked examples exactly. The DB was reset afterward.
- All three Network Diagnostics tools were called directly: TX-512 reproduces
  Scenario 3 exactly (OPERATIONAL, 3.8% packet loss, INC-8841 open); FL-090
  correctly reads OFFLINE/100% loss on the latest sample only.
- Both ADK services start for real, publish correct agent cards (with full
  tool schemas) at `/.well-known/agent-card.json` on ports 8001/8002, and
  `to_a2a` / `RemoteA2aAgent` construct without error against the installed
  `google-adk` version.
- The LlamaIndex document RAG index and the semantic-SQL `ObjectIndex` both
  build successfully (embedding model downloads and runs locally).
- The LangGraph graph compiles with all six expected nodes; the CrewAI crew
  constructs with both agents and both tasks.
- The Streamlit app was run through Streamlit's official `AppTest` harness:
  sidebar status detection, the Submit → response → Agent Execution Trace
  flow, the empty-trace message, and the `st.error` path were all exercised
  and render exactly as specified in section 6.8 — this caught and fixed one
  real bug (a bare ternary `st.success(...) if x else st.error(...)`
  statement that Streamlit's "magic" display feature can't parse; now plain
  `if/else`).

What was **not** run, since it spends real API credits you'd need to
provide: an actual end-to-end query through the LangGraph supervisor (LLM
routing decision → LlamaIndex/ADK/CrewAI LLM calls → final answer). Everything
that call chain depends on has been verified individually above.

## Design notes / how this maps to the spec's build instructions (section 6)

- **No in-memory dictionaries**: every ADK tool (`adk-services/*/agent.py`)
  opens a fresh SQLite connection via `common/db.py` per call; nothing about
  towers, incidents, balances, or credits is cached in Python.
- **LlamaIndex used only for retrieval**: `document_rag.py` and
  `sql_semantic_search.py` expose plain functions via `as_query_engine()` /
  `SQLTableRetrieverQueryEngine` — no LlamaIndex agents/workflows.
- **Billing credit rule** (`apply_billing_credit` in
  `adk-services/billing_resolution/agent.py`): amount ≤ $50.00 → `APPLIED`,
  balance reduced; amount > $50.00 → `PENDING_APPROVAL`, balance unchanged —
  matches `billing_disputes_policy.txt` and the schema comments exactly.
- **Diagnostics use the latest sample only**: all tower_performance lookups
  filter to `MAX(recorded_at)` per tower, never an average.
- **Supervisor guarantees CustomerCommsCrew runs last**: `graph.py`'s
  `supervisor_node` uses an LLM with structured output for routing, but also
  hard-enforces (in code) that FINISH is never chosen until CustomerCommsCrew
  has already run, and caps total worker hops to prevent loops.
- **RemoteA2aAgent pattern**: `adk_remote_client.py` wraps each remote ADK
  service in a lightweight local proxy `Agent` (whose only sub_agent is the
  `RemoteA2aAgent`) and drives it with an ADK `Runner`; if a service's port
  isn't reachable, LangGraph gets back a clear message naming the exact
  command to start it, instead of an exception.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Database: Not found" in the sidebar** → run `python init_db.py` from the project root.
- **ADK service shows "Not running"** → start it in its own terminal (see step 2); check that nothing else is bound to port 8001/8002.
- **PolicyRAG/NetworkAnalytics errors mentioning API keys** → confirm the key matching your `LLM_PROVIDER` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`) is set in `.env` and the process was started after `.env` was saved.
- **Rebuilding the vector index** after editing a policy doc → delete `data/vector_index/` and resubmit a policy query.
- **Resetting demo data** (e.g. after applying credits during a walkthrough) → re-run `python init_db.py`; it drops and recreates every table.
